<b> Lab | <b> Measuring pressure using piezoelectric pick up.
<b> Experiment|     <b> 2. Measuring pressure using piezoelectric pick up.

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

•	To identify and use different types of instruments for measurement. 
•	To understand the transducers circuit and its connection diagram.
•	To use transducers for the measurement of physical quantity like pressure.


<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

In this experiment, we can measure the pressure applied on a piezoelectric transducer by virtue of piezoelectric effect. According to piezoelectric effect, if we apply pressure on piezoelectric material it generates the voltage accordingly and by calibrating this voltage we can calculate the pressure applied to the material.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

B.Tech 3rd Semester - Electrical Engineering/ Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

Electrical Measurements and Instrumentation (KEE 302)

<h5> Universities Mapped : </h5>

Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam University Lucknow
